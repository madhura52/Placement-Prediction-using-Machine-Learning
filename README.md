# 🎓 Placement Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📘 Overview
This project aims to **predict student placements** using machine learning by analyzing academic, technical, and personal attributes.  
The goal is to help institutions and students understand key factors that influence placement outcomes.

## 🔍 Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover patterns in student data.  
- Build and compare multiple **Machine Learning models** to predict placement.  
- Identify key academic and skill-related factors that influence placement probability.  

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
- Decision Tree Classifier  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- XGBoost Classifier  
- CatBoost Classifier  

## 🧩 Dataset
The dataset includes student details such as CGPA, technical skills, certifications, internship experience, and placement status.  
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values and outliers  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Splitting data into training and testing sets  

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score  
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC-AUC Score  

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, CatBoost  

## 💡 Key Insights
- Students with higher CGPA and certifications have better placement chances.  
- Technical and communication skills both impact placement probability.  
- Internship experience improves placement likelihood.  
- XGBoost and Random Forest showed the best overall accuracy.
